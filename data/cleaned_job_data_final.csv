centralreach was developed for clinicians by clinicians. the story of centralreach begins at an aba clinic based out of pompano beach, florida. the company’s founder, a practicing board certified behavioral analyst, was drowning in manual management of her clinic from scheduling staff and filing claims to reporting on clinical data. she decided that there had to be a better way to manage her operations so she could spend more time on what mattered most — working with her clients and patients. to help aba practices focus on what they do best, centralreach launched the first iteration of its ehr and practice management platform in 2012.

today, under the leadership of chris sullens, an award-winning ceo in the technology space, centralreach is committed to their mission of providing cutting-edge technology and services to help clinicians and educators produce superior client and patient outcomes. already a market leader, centralreach is expected to grow exponentially through its four core tenets: hire and develop great people; build industry-leading products; provide exceptional service to customers and continuously invest in systems, processes and infrastructure.

leah labs is a y combinator and angel investor backed biotechnology startup using gene editing to revolutionize companion animal health with cell therapies. we’re founded by expert gene editors, leading veterinary scientists, and a renowned human car-t cell therapy physician.

the summary:

if climbing the academic ladder isn’t for you, this job certainly is. we are seeking a postdoctoral scientist or equivalent with entrepreneurial spirit for a 1-year appointment (beginning june 2020) in rochester, mn (#5 best place to live in 2019). you will be building non-viral car-t cell manufacturing workflows with both human and canine t cells with the ambitious goal of using what you build to treat sick dogs by the end of the appointment. if things go well (science milestones and business growth), the opportunity to extend this position or transition to full time employment with employee level equity in a company leadership role is high.

the postdoctoral scientist will have regular access to our world-class scientific founders with deep expertise in human car-t cell therapies, genome engineering, and veterinary science.

aspects of this position include project leadership, design and execution of lab experiments, innovative problem solving, and data analysis. a successful candidate will leverage their curiosity and creativity to design and implement a high-throughput pipeline for t cell engineering.

what you will do:
• develop and enhance t cell engineering pipelines using our cutting-edge, in-house gene editing platforms
• develop, update, and maintain experimental and workflow sops
• recommend next steps based on experimental analysis
• maintain auditable, patent-detailed experimental records

how you’ll grow:

within 1 month: you will understand our company vision, you will be learning our gene editing technology and our current standard workflows, and you will be hypothesizing how to make our platforms better.

within 3 months: you will be working independently on optimizing cell programming technology, building car-t cells, and testing their in vitro functions.

within 12 months: you will have built a non-viral car-t cell manufacturing workflow that is ready for scale. your lead candidate car-t cell has been tested in usda-cvb level safety studies and are on the road to treating sick dogs with our veterinary partners.

throughout the year: you will have the chance to attend leading science conferences to present your work. you will be an author on any patent applications developed with your effort. importantly, your lab work will be detailed, organized, and publication-ready with the goal of a biorxiv submission on our novel t cell programming work and cell therapy innovation.

what you must bring:
• ph.d. in cell biology, immunology, biochemistry, or a related discipline with direct experience in car-t cell analysis and/or in vitro t cell biology

• published record in immuno-oncology or cell biology

• familiarity with ngs/sequencing library preparation and analysis, and other high-throughput platforms
• experience with lab robotics platforms

recognizing covid-19 uncertainty:

as this posting is being drafted (march 2020), we are in the midst of the global covid-19 outbreak. we recognize the fluidity in this situation and note that in person interviews will likely be delayed or impossible. we also recognize that the timeline for full-time start of this position may be pushed to july or august.

the bottom line:

• competitive salary commensurate with experience and credentials

• company equity, pto, choose your own holidays, and health care benefits

final notes:

“if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life” – cliché, right? maybe, but our founders live this motto. if you’re looking for a “job”, leah labs probably isn’t for you.

if the above sounds like a fit, and you’re willing to jump into a fast-paced startup environment with a growing team of exceptional scientists, please send your c.v. and a few sentences about why you’re ready to build cell therapies for dogs to wes@leahlabs.com.

because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the apis to power it. to help us, we follow the json api spec, but any experience in building a restful api will be useful. remember, the api is your contract with the consumers of your data!

understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures
izeax still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. we move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.

basic linux skills
in order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. this means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through clis. examples include the ember cli, the rails cli/console, docker commands, gradle, and our own clis. we'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.

ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests
izea's engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. in order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. this is part of what agile means to us.

excellent verbal and written communications skills
regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. you should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. you should prioritize documentation of processes and code.

demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued

data science background
while not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. practical experience with machine learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.

front end development experience
from time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. familiarity with modern web frameworks like angular, react, ember, or vue would be helpful. extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or highcharts.

amazon web services, or other cloud providers
izea's software is hosted on aws, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. familiarity with amazon’s emr would also be an asset.

continuous integration & deployment
izea needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. to facilitate this, we have developed a ci/cd pipeline (using 3rd party services). an understanding of what ci/cd is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.

github
all of izea's code is source controlled on github. we leverage github pull requests for code reviews, github integrations manage parts of our ci/cd pipeline, and github releases define the code tags that ultimately get deployed. much of our process documentation exists on github pages. familiarity with navigating github's features will help you ramp up in our sdlc faster.

jira
izea uses jira to manage projects and report on progress to stakeholders inside and outside the company. while we strive to automate as much of jira as possible with bots, webhooks and reports, understanding how jira issues, links, attachments, and workflows work will help you understand our sdlc faster.

about izea:

we are izea: the creator marketplace. our cloud-based technologies connect brands and publishers with content creators who blog, tweet, pin, and post on their behalf.

our driving belief is that the only way to thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. izea is in a constant state of evolution and reinvention. while we may have invented the industry, we still operate like an entrepreneurial, scrappy start-up. your time here will be exciting, educational, and at times, a bit crazy.

with izea, you have the opportunity to join a non-traditional corporate culture, where creativity and productivity are valued over a suit and tie. we call it ""the izea way.""


why would you want to work here?

our developers use the latest tools and technology to build the applications and services that make up the izea exchange platform. we write in whatever language we need to get the job done including ruby, java, python, php, swift, and javascript. we leverage the latest frameworks, such as rails, symphony2, and drop wizard for iterating quickly on our technology.

our code is deployed and operated by the people who write it, with the help of amazon web services. we leverage everything from ec2 for virtualization and hosting, to amazon emr and machine learning for advanced analytics.

aside from the day to day, we offer incredible benefits including an annual continuing education budget, a flexible trust-focused development process, and an open collaborative work environment.

our team is ego-free and motivated to build great software. we regularly break out into small teams to tackle problems, learn new technologies, or just share what we know with others. we test our code and invest in the health of our systems. we push each other, learn from each other, and strive to continually grow as a team.

you have experience with relational databases such as postgresql, oracle or sql server, and maybe even hadoop, hive, spark or redshift.
you strive to learn the newest and greatest techniques where bert/elmo are not just sesame street© characters.
what you’ll own

the roadmap of projects you’ll work on that tie directly to business goals and objectives.
manage the entire lifecycle of data projects from strategic planning to tactical activities (data collection, cleanup, analysis, model implementation).
sourcing new data for a firm that rarely scrapes, pulls or pushes.
facilitate communication throughout the development process between executive stakeholders, your users and technical teams.
coordinate and build strong working relations with various internal stakeholder groups, including it, engineering, and legal.

we don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. we specialize in data & analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. it sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. we often could speak to a cfo or head of underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. if we step across to the devops lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about apache committers, osf, full stack development, microservices, containers – you know – geek out. we’re not trying to boil the ocean. we want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. we have a lot of fun together. most people join here and stay here for the people. that said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. i have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you love cloud computing for big data and/or advanced analytics, machine learning, etc we should talk.

Staff Data Engineer,"sumo logic: staff data engineer


what we do:
we are a cloud-native saas machine data analytics platform, solving complex monitoring problems for devops, secops and itops teams. customers love our product because it allows them to easily monitor and optimize their mission critical, large scale applications.

massive scale:
our microservices architecture in aws ingests hundreds of terabytes daily across many geographic regions. millions of queries a day analyze hundreds of petabytes of data.

at sumo logic, we are building a data platform designed to power the analytics and investigations that are common in the security operation centers of large enterprises. it is designed to accept hundreds of billions of events from security-relevant data sources (detection products, network sensors, log shippers, inventory systems) per day. it is cloud-native, with no plan to support an on-premise deployment. it is multi-tenant, and is designed to simultaneously process events from thousands of our customers. and, it is security-focused — it is designed to perform the kinds of stateful analyses that security analysts demand.

we are building this platform the way startups should — with ruthless prioritization, and with a live and demanding customer base. by joining as a data engineer, you have the opportunity to make our vision a reality, one feature at a time.

what you will be doing
building, improving, maintaining, and scaling stream processing services.
writing code. reviewing code. revising code.
giving feedback on our standards. holding your team mates to them.
collaborating with teammates on major feature designs. sometimes, you will own features, sometimes others will.
helping our team grow organically. we value referrals. we value your feedback on candidates.
who you are
you are a software engineer. (we treat our data systems as software systems, and engineer them accordingly.)
you love working with data. (small data. big data. all the data.)
you are excited to optimize for events per second (not requests per second).
you have experience working with (or, at minimum a desire to work with) the technologies we use: kafka, rocksdb, elasticsearch, janusgraph, postgres, spark, hbase.
you know (or want to write software in) scala.
you love collecting data about your software as much as writing software that collects data. we measure everything. we make data-driven decisions.
you are collaborative. nothing this hard can be accomplished by working alone. we work as a team.
masters in computer science or equivalent experience (phd in cs is a huge plus)

at onethree biotech we’re working to change this using biology-driven ai. founded after members of our team lost family members to rare cancer, the team at onethree has spent the last 5+ years researching how we can combine ai with systems biology to stop this from happening to anyone else. we’re building a platform to not only predict new potential therapeutics, but also to pinpoint the mechanisms driving efficacy, and we pride ourselves on building a new form of biology-driven ai that values interpretability as much as accuracy. after raising a multi-million round of funding, we’re looking for a lead data engineer to join our interdisciplinary team as we look to ramp up external partnerships and internal development.

about the role:

data is core to onethree’s strategy and business. you will work directly with our chief data scientist and founding team to take ownership of developing a backend data infrastructure to both support onethree’s internal ai scientists and platform as well as external-facing partnerships. you will have the opportunity to work with cutting edge data tools and be part of a team working on the bleeding edge of machine learning + biology (based on years of peer-reviewed and partnerships with leading medical centers).

the ideal candidate will have an entrepreneurial mindset, be comfortable with creative problem solving, and will be excited to build a data processing pipeline from the ground-up in a flexible, fast-paced environment. this is a rare opportunity to get in at the early stage and take ownership over a product and strategy. if working on challenging problems that have a real positive impact excites you, then onethree is the place for you!

Data Engineer - Consultant (Charlotte Based),"do you love working with data in machine learning, real-time analytics, or big data in a cloud environment? do you find that you want to choose other technologies but work for a vendor that limits the options that you can recommend? we are looking for a data expert to help us help our clients evaluate and implement big data and advanced analytics solutions in the cloud. at clarity insights, we only provide data & analytics expertise. it’s all we’ve ever done and we love specializing in it and working on hard problems.

responsibilities

coordinates and leads internal meetings.

basic qualifications
bachelors degree and 3+ years of work experience
experience building processes around data transformation, data structures, metadata, dependency and workload management with object-oriented scripting languages such as python or other object-oriented/object-function languages (such as java, c++ or scala) is required.
strong sql experience analyzing, transforming and integrating high volume, complex data sources with considerations for accuracy and efficient performance.

why clarity insights, why consulting and why now?
we don’t try to be everything to everybody all the time. we specialize in data & analytics and will remain a platform and tool agnostic company so you can grow technically throughout your career. it sounds ridiculous but you actually need to be 100% technical and 100% business with strategy because we don’t hire non-communicative robots who have a one size fits all approach. we often could speak to a cfo or head of underwriting about a business or finance problem, and based on the need for real-time and affordable scalability, we can outline – in terms they can understand – why they should think about a cloud solution for big data and analytics. if we step across to the devops lab, we can easily pick up on a conversation about apache committers, osf, full stack development, microservices, containers and much more. we’re not trying to boil the ocean. we want to grow from 400 people to 1700 people in 4 years to take the market an accessible set of consulting skills. we have a lot of fun together. most people join here and stay here for the people. that said, we are popular so we do rack up some travel miles. i have a million things to share about why that may change and why that must stay the same for now, but here’s a suggestion – if you love cloud computing for big data and/or advanced analytics, machine learning, etc we should talk.

clarity insights is an equal employment opportunity employer. we believe in treating each employee and applicant for employment fairly and with dignity.
